MadEye
======

MadEye lets you share your coding projects with your friends.  Run it in the
project's directory, and then go to the madeye link.  Everyone can edit in 
real-time, like Google Docs.  When they save, the file is saved back onto your
local file system.

You can also use MadEye within Google Hangouts!  Just use the Hangout link,
and you'll be coding together with live video chat.
